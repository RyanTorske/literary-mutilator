<p id="header" onclick="changeColor()">Book: After the Earth was used up, we found a new solar system and hundreds of new Earths
	were terraformed and colonized. The central planets formed the Alliance and decided all the planets had to join under their
	rule. There was some disagreement on that point. After the War, many of the Independents who had fought and lost drifted to the
	edges of the system, far from Alliance control. Out here, people struggled to get by with the most basic technologies; a ship
	would bring you work, a gun would help you keep it. A captain's goal was simple: find a crew, find a job, keep flying.</p>
<p id="second" onclick="changeWord()">The Operative: You are fooling yourself, Captain. Nothing here is what it seems. You are
	not the plucky hero, the Alliance is not an evil empire, and this is not the grand arena.  Inara Serra:
	And that's not incense.</p>
<p id="third" onclick="wordColor()">Teacher: Earth that was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many. We found a new solar
	system, dozens of planets and hundreds of moons. Each one terraformed, a process taking decades, to support human life, to
	be new Earths. The Central Planets formed the Alliance. Ruled by an interplanetary parliament, the Alliance was a beacon of
	civilization. The savage outer planets were not so enlightened and refused Alliance control. The war was devastating, but the
	Alliance's victory over the Independents ensured a safer universe. And now everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of
	our civilization.</p>
